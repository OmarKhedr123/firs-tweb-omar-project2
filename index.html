    <h2>What is a Mukbang?</h2>
    <p>
      A mukbang is a video that has someone (usually the host) eating a large
      quantity of food with their audience. And the quantities of food got
      <br />
      progressively larger over time, leading to more extravagant and visually
      "appealing" presentations.

    <h2>How it started out</h2>
    <p>
      Mukbangs started out as a South Korean live stream around 2009 and was
      live-streaming on platforms like AfreecaTV, as a cultural response to
      <br />
      loneliness and changing eating habits in South Korea.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>How it rose to fame</h2>
    <p>
      Mukbangs gained popularity through social media influencers like Tzuyang,
      Hamzy, Nikocado Avocado, Bloveslife, and Trisha Paytas,YouTube,
      <br />
      where creators could reach a global audience. The combination of food,
      entertainment, and interaction made mukbangs a unique form of content that
      <br />
      appealed to many viewers.
