        <h2>What is a Mukbang?</h2>
      </u>
      <p>
        A mukbang is a video that has someone (usually the host) eating a large
        quantity of food with their audience. And the quantities of food got
        <br />
        progressively larger over time, leading to more extravagant and visually
        <i>"appealing"</i> presentations.

      <p>
        Mukbangs started out as a South Korean live stream around 2009 and was
        live-streaming on plat forms like AfreecaTV, as a cultural response to
        <br />
        loneliness and <b>changing eating habits in South Korea.</b>

        Mukbangs gained popularity through social media influencers like
        <mark>
          Tzuyang, Hamzy, Nikocado Avocado, Bloveslife, and Trisha Paytas
        </mark>
        , on YouTube,
        <br />
