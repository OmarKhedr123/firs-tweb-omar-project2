      <p>
        A mukbang is a video that has someone (usually the host) eating a large
        quantity of food with their audience. And the quantities of food got
        <br />
        progressively larger over time, leading to more extravagant and visually
        <i>"appealing"</i> presentations.

      <h2>How it started out</h2>
      <p>
        Mukbangs started out as a South Korean live stream around 2009 and was
        live-streaming on platforms like AfreecaTV, as a cultural response to
        <br />
        loneliness and <b>changing eating habits in South Korea.</b>
      </p>
      <br />
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>How it rose to fame</h2>
      <p>
        Mukbangs gained popularity through social media influencers like
        <mark
          >Tzuyang, Hamzy, Nikocado Avocado, Bloveslife, and Trisha Paytas</mark
        >, on YouTube,
        <br />
        where creators could reach a global audience. The combination of food,
        entertainment, and interaction made mukbangs a unique form of content
        that
        <br />
        appealed to many viewers.
